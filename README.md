# Quote Generator Web App
## Code along Zero to Mastery Udemy Tutorial
This tutorial has helped deepen my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript and DOM manipulation using Vanilla JavaScript.
### How it works
This app randomly displays one quote out of all the quotes fetched from an API.
For each quote displayed, it shows the quote and the corresponding author.
There is a tweet button to allow user tweet a quote directly from the app.
There is also a next button that allows you view the next randomly selected quote.
The next button does not make a server request because on load, all quotes are fetched.

### Added Features
The description above are the features covered in the tutorial. However, as a user experience enthusiast, I am thinking of adding features to improve on the user experience.Features already added include
+ A set interval function that automatically displays a new quote.
+ A clear interval function that automatically restarts the timing for the new quote.
+ A numbering display that shows the number of the current quote and total number of quotes.

### Additional features
I plan to add more features like
+ Next and previous quote functions
+ Option to allow user set how quotes should be displayed (orderly/Randomly)
+ Option to allow user go to a random particular quote number

### Improvements
In the far future i will incoporate server-side concept for some advanced functions
